# Stereoscopic Autofocus System (Hailo + RealSense)

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent autofocus system using the Intel RealSense D455 stereo camera, YOLO-based detection, and a Hailo-8 AI accelerator. The system estimates subject distance and controls a stepper motor to adjust focus for cine lenses in real time.
